#looking up Zack's mlb id (425844)
#zgID <- playerid_lookup(last_name = "Greinke", first_name = "Zack")$mlbam_id
zgID <- 425844

#getting the data from baseball savant with baseballr
#for Greinke's start on opening day, 04/07/22
zg <- statcast_search(start_date = "2022-04-07", 
                end_date = "2022-04-07",
                player_type = "pitcher",
                playerid = zgID)

```

Here are the plays that Zack was involved in during his April 7 start:

```{r, echo = F}
zg %>% filter(type == "X" & str_detect(zg$des, "Greinke")) %>% 
  select(inning, at_bat_number, pitch_number, pitch_name, release_speed, launch_speed, launch_angle, des)

```
